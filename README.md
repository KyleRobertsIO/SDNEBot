## What's it do?

The **SDNE Bot** or **Syndey** is a Discord Bot built for the **Software Design & Network Engineering** program's Discord Server. The Bot allows users to set their roles such as year & campus as well as interact with the bot to provide functionality not available in a *vanilla* Discord server.

## What's New

- Updated to Discord.js v12
- Reaction based interaction system
- Commands available based on permissions instead of role
- Uses database to save user info and get configurations
- React to a message with ðŸ“Œ to save it
- Bot automatically welcomes new users once they assign a role for the first time
- Automatic Kick/Ban System based off warnings

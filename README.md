## What's it do?

The **SDNE Bot** or **Syndey** is a Discord Bot built for the **Software Design & Network Engineering** program's Discord Server. The Bot allows users to set their roles such as year & campus as well as interact with the bot to provide functionality not available in a *vanilla* Discord server.

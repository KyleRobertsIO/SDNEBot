Basically I wrote a program in Eclipse w/ proper indentation, but when I navigated to it's .java file (using file explorer, you know by going to my java workspace, going to 'src'...), the indentation of the file is all messed up when opening the .java file in Notepad. But if I open the file in Notepad++ it looks fine and properly indented. Do you guys know what I should do? BTW this happens only with java files I wrote in Eclipse, NetBeans java files are properly formatted. I'm asking this because I need to submit .java files to my Java prof this semester and don't want marks taken off because of improper indentation. Thanks",
